A GUI Password Validator in Python is an application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input and validate passwords. It typically ensures that the password meets certain criteria, such as matching a confirmation password, having a minimum length, or containing specific characters (e.g., numbers, uppercase letters).

This type of application is commonly built using GUI libraries such as Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy in Python. Below is an overview of a Password Validator GUI:
Features of a GUI Password Validator
Password Input Fields:

Two input fields for entering and confirming the password.
Option to mask the input (e.g., * for hidden passwords).
Validation Criteria:

Basic: Ensure the password matches the confirmation password.
Advanced: Check additional criteria, such as:
Minimum length.
Inclusion of numbers, uppercase letters, and special characters.
Feedback Messages:

Inform the user if the password is valid or if validation failed (e.g., "Password does not match" or "Password must contain at least 8 characters").
Button for Validation:

A button to trigger the validation process.
Visual Feedback:

Feedback displayed in a different color (e.g., green for success, red for failure).
How to Create a GUI Password Validator in Python (with Tkinter)
Steps:
Import Required Libraries: Use Tkinter for the GUI and functools.partial to handle function arguments.

Create the GUI Layout:

Design input fields for the password and confirmation password.
Add a button to check the validity.
Write the Validation Logic:

Compare the entered password with the confirmation password.
Optionally, check for additional password strength criteria.
Display Feedback:

Use Label widgets to display success or error messages.
